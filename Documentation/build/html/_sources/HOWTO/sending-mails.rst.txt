Sending Mails
-------------
As you probably read, we accept contributions via mail.
Contribution mails have a syntax!

Your subject should look like the following:
Subject: Contribution to wOS: <feature name/summary>

The body must have an explanation of what the feature is and
the files changed (or just a diff)
