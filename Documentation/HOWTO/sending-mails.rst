Sending Mails
=============
As you have probably read, we accept contributions via mail.

Your subject should look like the following:
``Subject: Contribution to wOS: <feature name/summary>``

The body must have an explanation of what the feature is and
the files changed (or just a diff)

We are working on a mailing list, but it's still not perfect.
