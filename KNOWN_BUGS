Known Bugs
==========

* `make run` currently does nothing. Use `make debug`.
  This is because of interrupts not working (?).
  We are trying to fix this, but it will take some time (maybe in 1.2.0)

  Resort to using `make debug` and `c` to continue in gdb to launch it
  with a different bootloader.

* GitLab CI/CD Doesn't work.
  It just doesn't want to.
