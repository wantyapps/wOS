Kernel Docs - Help Wanted!
==========================

What file to document?
----------------------

Almost every file in:

- cpu/
- drivers/
- kernel/

Rules
-----

All public (accessible) functions need to be documented.
Documentation can vary: One function can have a single sentence documentation,
while other functions can have long and detailed explanations.

Syntax
------

Documentation blocks have the following syntax:

```c
/* Title of function/quick explanation
 * Description - What arguments are used etc. (Can be multiple lines if needed)
 *
 * Declaration
 */
```

For example:

```c
/* sum - return sum of two numbers
 * When given two integer arguments (x,y), the function will
 * return the sum of the two arguments.
 *
 * int sum(int x, int y)
 */
int sum(int x, int y) {
	return x + y;
}
```

What _NOT_ to Document
----------------------

Simple functions that show exactly what they are doing in their declaration/source code
do not need to be documented.

For example:

The function above (``sum``) does not need to be documented. _It was just an example._
